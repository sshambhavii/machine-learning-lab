Lab 2 - 09/08/2023

Question 13 - How many records are present in the dataset? Print the metadata information of the dataset.
df.info()
df.shape


Question 14 - Draw a bar plot to show the number of persons having CHD or not in comparison to they having family history of the disease or not.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sn
famhist_chd_comparison = pd.crosstab(df['famhist'], df['chd'])
barplot = famhist_chd_comparison.plot(kind='bar')


Question 19 - Find out the number of CHD cases in different age categories. Do a barplot and sort them in the order of age groups.
agegroups = []
i = 0
for i in range(len(df)):
    if df['age'][i] <= 15:
        agegroups.append('young')
    elif df['age'][i] <= 35:
        agegroups.append('adults')
    elif df['age'][i] <= 55:
        agegroups.append('mid')
    else:
        agegroups.append('old')

df['agegroup'] = agegroups 
df.head(20)

sn.barplot(x=df['agegroup'],y=df['chd'],order=['young','adults','mid','old'])


Question 20 - Draw a box plot to compare distributions of ldl for different age groups.
sn.boxplot(x=df['agegroup'],y=df['ldl'],order=['young','adults','mid','old'])
